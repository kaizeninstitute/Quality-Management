        <section id="main_content">
          <p>A MNC of Swedish country situated in Rajpur Town of Mehsana Area, 40 kms from Ahmedabad, produces Cold Finished Seamless Stainless Steel Austenitic and also Duplex Instrumentation and Heat-exchanger Tubes, Hot Extruded Piping, Hollow Pubs as well as Redraw Hollows-- all made under one roof.</p>

<p>It is a high-technology, engineering team with advanced items. Worldwide business activities are carried out via representation in more than 130 countries. In 2010 the Group had 47,000 workers enthusiastically working for achieving Company Excellence. It's products would be based upon high value content &amp; are developed in close participation with clients.</p>

<p>This organization has, over the years, developed its own production hvac systems named SMT Company Hvac system as well as has a group of Lean Production Navigators who go around their locations and also assist in the application of SMT company hvac systems. High quality is the assisting principle in the international procedures.</p>

<p>Recalls one of the managers of the facility; "... no person appeared to know that Sandvik Asia handled steel. It was understood for tooling items. We understood that we had to function from the ground up to set up the SANDVIK brand name in steel arena." The trip of achieving vision of becoming our portal to Asian's tube world started then.</p>

<p>They strongly cared about 3 factors--.</p>

<p>*** Open Mind,.**</p>

<p>*** Fairy play as well as.**</p>

<p>*** Team spirit.**</p>

<p>Open mindedness consistently helped them to have a positive state of mind to frequent adjustments in the marketplace, motivate originalities and look for enhancement opportunities.</p>

<p>Fair play suggested equal opportunities, reasonable trade, respect to specific as well as problem for environment.</p>

<p>Esprit de corps meant proceeding in a safe manner with enthusiastic assistance and trust from co-workers.</p>

<p>As it is commonly said, 5S is the structure for every improvement program. They realized it as well as with the support from SMT Business System, exercising it everyday. "Although we had our own <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lean/environment/methods/fives.htm">5S implementation system</a>, we found out a great deal from Kaizen Institute on 5S and the auditing process that assisted us additional improve our 5S application." states the Constant Improvement Supervisor. The physical environment that is unlike in the various other tube producing devices verifies to be a spirits booster for all the workers. They happily asserts that It is the only plant in India which adheres to worldwide requirements of manufacturing, safety, sanitation for the properties and also the manpower.</p>

<p>With the growing needs of the consumers and also expansion on the market, result from the devices showed a traffic jam. With the equipments working greater than 4 decades, the integrity of the devices stayed highly uncertain and also the timetable of complying with the customers' demands were always not satisfied. They really felt that there is a bunch of concealed possible within the tools hesitating to be made use of. So, they invited Kaizen Institute to apply TPM practices in their facility. Although they had an interior Lean execution group, the open mindedness technique of Sandvik allowed them to make use of the services of Kaizen Institute in executing TPM for their vital tools. The TPM journey obtained kicked-off in August 2010 with Kaizen Institute promoting Sandvik.</p>

<p>Among the managers claims, "At first, we thought that TPM would certainly be an additional management lingo nevertheless, once the execution began and also the perks started coming in, we sincerely feel that this is a crucial device that is essentially required to implement LEAN manufacturing hvac system".</p>

<p>"Initially, we utilized to state in lighter capillary that we are making pipes now from tags and not from machines. The tagging workout is an eye-opener! We never understood that we were running the devices with numerous abnormalities. Undoubtedly, this (TPM) has actually offered us a new lens to check out points ..." states an additional staff member of Sandvik.</p>

<p>"Tagging &amp; maintaining a Tag register was indeed useful. Consistently, throughout tagging, we located busted parts near the brake assembly in Pilger device. Later, we discovered that the brake cellular lining has established a fracture. Marking assisted us prevent a major failure in this regard." claims the Replacement Manager of Maintenance department.</p>

<p>"To be honest, we never ever believed that we can doing this a lot in 5 days as well as identifying today (on the very first GKW) showed that we can do a whole lot in GKWs. One Issue Driving lesson is a reliable device that can be used to instruct the alreadying existing employees as well as brand-new comers as well." claims our Kaizen coordinator.</p>

<p>Accessibility renovation is one more crucial aspect we learnt in self-governing upkeep. Our Cellar areas were thoroughly overlooked area. We constantly believed it was a curse to enter this area. It used to be dark, filled with overflowing filth, dust. After application of Preliminary Cleansing, this location is not a location of curse. We made lots of little improvements in boosting ease of access that led to decreasing hours shed in minor interruptions in Extrusion procedure ... claims an Upkeep Engineer.</p>

<p>"Why-Why analysis is a tool we got as a present from TPM workout. Nowadays, we use this tool really commonly about resolve the majority of our issues. This caused making special devices for cleaning the feed carriage of Pilger device which conserved us enormous time which is the goal of AM step 2 ..."states the Production-in-charge of Pilger process.</p>

<p>"We have our own computer system software program system of monitoring Upkeep tasks, yet, Equipment Ranking sheet, Devices control journal were brand-new to us that assisted us on selecting the ideal devices for our activities &amp; tracking the cost of Maintenance. Also the loss-tree charting of 16 losses truly opened our eyes in lots of elements. This had provided us a concept of how you can pick our projects, what to do and where to do to improve our Plant performance. We discovered the best ways to determine MTBF, MTTR that gave us a concentrate on our enhancement tasks." claims one of the Upkeep Engineers.</p>

<p>"Kaizen bursts, Little renovations, motivate our staff members and produce a healthy and balanced competition amongst them. As a matter of fact, employees from other Gemba have actually started irritating us to launch TPM in their sections too. We will certainly be horizontally setting up TPM in other areas as well in a short while from now." claims one of their Managers.</p>

<p>"... yes, our OEE is raised, state from 46 % to 65 % now. Still, we have a lengthy way to go. We are only in AM Action 2 as well as we have lot more to cover. As they state, this is a quest and also it never ends.".</p>

<p>"I need to mention that in the recently held Union conference, the union members volunteered to carry out AM tasks by Operators that is a huge cultural adjustment we viewed. Fully credit visits our Supervisors that made this occur by engaging in TPM in their GEMBA ..." states the President of this company.</p>

<p>To achieve Company Excellence, <a href="http://in.kaizen.com/">Operational Excellence</a> is required. The trip to Operational Excellence is basic however not easy. They firmly relies on these three sayings:.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We are what we repeatedly do.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Excellence is not an act however a behavior.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>We will certainly locate a much better method or else we make one.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>They are certain in achieving their Vision 2015 by adjusting the practices developed by SMT Business hvac system as well as various other Operational Excellence practices they get via other facilities.</p>
